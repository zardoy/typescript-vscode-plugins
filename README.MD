# TypeScript Essential Plugins

## Top Features

### JSX Outline

(*disabled by default*) Enable with `tsEssentialPlugins.patchOutline`

Also is not supported in the web.

## **Completions Built Different**

90% work done in this extension highly improves completions experience!

### Method Snippets

(*enabled by default*)

Expands arrow callbacks with signature snippet with adding additional undo stack!

Example:

```ts
const callback = (arg) => {}
callback -> callback(arg)
```

### Strict Emmet

(*enabled by default*) when react langs are in `emmet.excludeLanguages`

Emmet that is active **only** inside JSX tags!

You can force enable this by using `Enable Strict Emmet in JSX` command.

*Why?* Issues it fixes: [query](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+51537+150671+142978+119736).

### Indexed Signature Completions

```ts

//          adds suggestions ^      ^ deranks admin suggestion
```
